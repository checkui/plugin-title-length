# plugin: Title length

This plugin is simply a "hello world".

It simply measures the length of a webpage `title` meta tag `value`.

It has a server that ships with it, because it is meant to demonstrate a stand-alone endpoint. The common use-case for a simple plugin would be a hosted Lambda, but this example is intended to run without any remote requests.
