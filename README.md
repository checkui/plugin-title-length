# Title length plugin

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/checkui/plugin-title-length.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/checkui/plugin-title-length)

This is a "hello world" to CheckUI plugin development.

It measures the length of a webpage `title` tag.

It has a server that ships with it as it is meant to demonstrate a stand-alone endpoint. The common use-case for a plugin would be a hosted Lambda, but we make no assumptions about how youâ€™d like to serve your API. This example is intended to run without remote requests.
